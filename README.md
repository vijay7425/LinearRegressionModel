# LinearRegressionModel 

## California Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices in California using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The dataset used for this project contains various features such as the median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, and geographical location (latitude and longitude) for each block group in California.

## Data Cleaning

Before building the machine learning model, the dataset underwent several data cleaning steps. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and scaling the features to ensure that they are on a similar scale.

## Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset. This involved analyzing the distribution of various features, identifying correlations between features, and visualizing the data using plots such as histograms and scatter plots.

## Model Building

The machine learning model was built using linear regression, a commonly used algorithm for predicting continuous values. The model was trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) to assess its performance.

## Results

The trained model achieved a decent level of accuracy in predicting house prices based on the features provided. However, further improvements could be made by using more advanced machine learning algorithms or by including additional features in the model.
